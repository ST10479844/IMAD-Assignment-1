# IMAD-Assignment-1
I have created an app that assists people with meal suggestions. The app consists of a designer, Front end code and back end code. The app suggests meals to its user based on what time of the day the user enters. 
Here are some screenshots of the app.

The final part of my Front end code, has 1 button and 1 textview. The button is a reset button that clears everything that the user has entered if the user has made a mistake. The textview is the resut text that will show the user their meal based on the time of the day.

This image introduces part 1 of my Backend code which is the main part of my app. I have declared my time of the day input, save button, meal suggestion, reset button, and result text. I also added what meals I want my app to suggest to the user based on thier time of the day input.
